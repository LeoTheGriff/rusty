# Rusty

This repository contains my notes, for personal reference, from learning Rust via the [Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

It is an open repository because there is nothing sensitive. If you're browsing this projects and want more detailed information, please refer to the book directly.

I recommend the book, it's been concise and well-structured.
